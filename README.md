# node-constructor-app

Well, I feel like I have all of the logic here, but I can't get past the first guess. It keeps returning the error "Can't read property 'indexOf' of null in my Word.js constructor. Both the letter and the word are clearly defined, and can be returned in the console, so I don't know why it keeps showing as null when checked into Word.js. 

I'd really appreciate any help on this. I know this assignment is optional, but I still want to get it right and perfect.

Thanks,

Patrick East
